# wingman-spawner — Roadmap

This roadmap is not a feature list.

It is a sequence of governance upgrades designed to make autonomous execution  
safe, reproducible, and responsibility-preserving.  

---

## Current Release

### v0.1 — Wingman Replication Chassis (Complete)
- `/agents/` established as reusable agent contracts
- `/primitives/` established as governance DNA
- core operator logic implemented through enforceable primitives
- repo structured as a spawnable chassis

Status: **READY**

---

## Next Release

### v0.2 — Operator Training Layer
Goal: make the chassis usable by non-developers without losing rigor.

Planned additions:

- training folder shipped
- /training/ quickstart for new Operators
- operator checklists (pre-run / mid-run / post-run)
- standard failure-mode catalog
- minimal “operator certification loop” concept

Status: **IN PROGRESS**

---

## v0.3 — Multi-Agent Coordination Rules
Goal: prevent cascade when agents coordinate.

Planned additions:
- orchestration constraints (“no silent delegation”)
- explicit agent-to-agent handshakes
- audit trail requirements for cross-agent calls
- “compound learning” loop template

Status: **PLANNED**

---

## v0.4 — Spore Dispersal Infrastructure
Goal: turn wingman-spawner into a propagation engine.

Planned additions:
- templates for publishing agents to other repos
- “spawn kit” generator workflow
- standardized README insertion blocks
- attribution + governance inheritance rules

Status: **PLANNED**

---

## v0.5 — Compliance Mapping Layer
Goal: make primitives legible to corporate governance ecosystems.

Planned additions:
- mapping to common governance frameworks (NIST AI RMF, ISO, etc.)
- corporate operator role definitions
- risk register template
- incident response playbook

Status: **PLANNED**

---

## v1.0 — Governance Spine Locked
Goal: freeze primitives as canonical infrastructure.

Criteria:
- P-01 through P-06 are stable
- primitives are internally consistent across agent types
- refusal behaviors are reliable and enforceable
- rollback/interrupt rules are tested across real workflows

Status: **TARGET**

---

## Long Horizon

### v2.0+ — Governance Organisms
Goal: enable living, self-correcting agent ecosystems.

Possible expansions:
- coherence drift detection systems
- field-based governance protocols
- multi-operator consensus primitives
- shared audit ledgers across organizations

Status: **VISION**
