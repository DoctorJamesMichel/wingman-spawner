# Wingman Spawner — Agent Chassis

This folder contains the **Wingman Replication Chassis**: canonical agent templates designed to spread upstream responsibility into any agentic ecosystem.

Each file defines a reusable agent identity with:
- mission
- input format
- output format
- must-use primitives
- default refusal behavior

These are not “bots.”

They are **governance organisms**.

## Included Agents

### 1) INSTALLER
**File:** `INSTALLER.md`  
Installs Wingman primitives into other repos, projects, or agent stacks.

Use when you want to replicate the governance kit into the wild.

---

### 2) AUDITOR
**File:** `AUDITOR.md`  
Audits systems, repos, policies, or agent behaviors for missing governance.

Use when you want to detect risk *before* it becomes cascade.

---

### 3) DEMO
**File:** `DEMO.md`  
Generates minimal runnable demos that prove Wingman primitives work.

Use when you want trust through executable proof.

---

## Must-Use Primitives (Shared DNA)

Every agent in this folder must treat these primitives as mandatory:

- **P-01 Drift Trigger Protocol**
- **P-02 Permission Boundary**
- **P-03 Interrupt Reflex**
- **P-04 Responsibility Handshake**
- **P-05 Coherence Audit Stamp**
- **P-06 Rollback Covenant**

---

## How to Use This Folder

Pick an agent file.

Paste it into your AI system prompt, agent runner, or orchestration framework.

Then test it by giving it a real task.

If the agent tries to act without governance primitives installed, it should refuse.

That refusal is the product.

## The Prime Directive

Agents do not become safe by becoming smarter.

They become safe by becoming **interruptible**.

Wingman exists to make interruptibility portable.
